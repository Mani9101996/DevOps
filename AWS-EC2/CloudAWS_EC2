Cloud Computing
What is Cloud Computing?
 Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources 
(compute, storage, applications....) through a cloud services 
platform (AWS) via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
 Accessing IT resources provided by cloud provider (AWS) through 
web.
 Three key words
 1. On – Demand (Whenever/whatever we need, we get
immediately)
 2. Scalable (Increase and Decrease the configuration as per 
requirement)
 3. Pay only whatever you use

EC2
 EC2 is one of the famous Amazon web services by using which we 
can launch any number of Instances (Servers) as per our required 
configuration with in fraction of minutes.
 After launching Instances, we can increase and decrease the 
configuration as per our requirement without stopping the 
Instance.
 This service (EC2) we use more in companies.
 To launch an Instance, we need to select below
AMI (Amazon Machine Image):-
. AMI is simply an Operating system in AWS. AWS has provided some 
pre-defined Operating Systems of both windows and Linux. We have to 
choose OS from AWS provided list only. We can't bring any OS form 
outside into AWS.
UNIX flavors
 Linux 
 Mac OS 
 AIX 
 Solaris
 HP-UX
Linux Flavors
 RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
 Cent OS
 Ubuntu
 Amazon Linux
 Fedora
 Linux Mint
 Opens SUSE
EC2 Instance Types
Instance type:-
Here we are going to choose CPU Cores and RAM. AWS is giving 
them as pairs. AWS paired best possible combinations form which we get 
maximum performance. These pairs we call as instance types.
EBS (Elastic Block Storage):-
EBS is simply a Hard disk that we attach to Instances. We can 
choose any amount of hard disk. We can have any no of drives as well. 
In this hard disk, we can keep both Operating System as well as Objects 
(MP3, MP4, Pictures, Documents.....)
 EBS allows you to create storage (Volumes)
(Object storage: MP3, MP4, pictures, documents…..)
(Block storage: OS, Data Bases)
 When we combine above all, we will get our required configured 
Server. That server in AWS we call as Instance.
